### Two Major Part of Threats to the Computers
1. Traditional Physical Security Threat
   - Overt Physical Threats 
   - Covert Physical Threats
   
2. Cybersecurity Threat
   - Computer Security
   - Network Security
   - Data Security
		
### Common Cybersecurity Threat
1. Malware (Malicious Software)
   - Malware is a general term used for software that is designed to:
      - disrupt computer operation
      - gather sensitive information
      - gain access to private computer system
     
   - It can appear in the form of:
      - code
      - scripts
      - active content
      - other software

   - Types of Malware:
      1. Virus 
         - What is virus:
            - A computer virus is the computer program that self-replicates.
            
         - A computer virus is a malicious program whcih is designed to:
            1. Alter the computer functions
            2. Damage the valuable files on the computer drive
            3. Slow down the comptuer performance
            
         - Main sources of virus propagation
            1. Infected File Downloading from Internet

	          1. Objective of a worm is to spread over the computers in a network
	          2. By exploiting the vulnerabilities in the computer OS and computer network.
	          3. Considered to be harmless without payload.
	          4. But when additional payloads are added to the worms, they can become dangerous in installing other malicious programs hidden in the payloads.
	          
         - Consume the major portions of the computer resources:
	          1. Bandwith
	          2. Hard Disk
	          3. Memory
	          
         - Recognize computer infected by Worms
	          1. Some errors related to the OS and system files appear
	          2. Firewall warnings may pop-up in certain cases
	          3. Stange icons or files appear on the desktop
	          4. The performance of computer slow downs
